## *Ph.D. Candidate in Ecological Systems*

<font size= "4">(**Full CV upon request**)</font>

<font size="5"> I am a movement and spatial ecologist that specializes in marine systems and quantitative methods. I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in the **Bailey lab at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science** ([link](https://www.umces.edu/helen-bailey)) and the **Fagan lab at the University of Maryland College Park** ([link](http://science.umd.edu/biology/faganlab/index.html)). 

  My dissertation focuses on the movement ecology of sea turtles through different life stages. In addition to my dissertation research, I have a strong interest in citizen science, science outreach & STEM education initiatives, and interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge social and natural sciences. </font>
