# **Nicole Barbour**

## *Postdoctoral Researcher, Movement and Spatial Ecology*

<font size= "4">(**Full CV upon request**)</font>

<font size="4"> I am currently a postdoctoral reseacher in the **Gurarie lab at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry**([link](https://eligurarie.github.io/)). I work on **The Fate of the Caribou**([link](https://fateofthecaribou.github.io/)) research project, developing quantitative tools in R to understand the permeability of roads to migrating boreal woodland (*Rangifer tarandus caribou*) and barren-ground (*Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus*) caribou sub-species in the Northwest Territories, Canada. My recent Ph.D. work (University of Maryland, 2022) focused on understanding the movement ecology and behavior of various sea turtle species in South and Central America.

<font size="4"> I am broadly interested in using quantitative and interdisciplinary approaches to better understand the movement ecology and habitat use of a variety of species to inform applied management tools and policy. 

<font size="4"> In addition to research, I have a strong interest in teaching, citizen science, science outreach, and interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge social and natural sciences. 

See the "Projects and Research" tab for details on some of my recent collaborations and work. See the "Teaching" tab for details on my teaching experience. </font>
