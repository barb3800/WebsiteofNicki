<h3><strong>Postdoctoral Research (SUNY College of Environmental Science
and Forestry): Quantifying Road Permeability for Migratory Caribou
(Paper in Prep)</strong></h3>
<p><img src="FateoftheCaribou.PNG" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Currently, through the <a
href="https://fateofthecaribou.github.io/">Fate of the Caribou
Project</a> and a contracted partnership with the Government of the
Northwest Territories, I am working to develop and apply a tool for
quantifying how strong of a deterrent linear barriers (e.g., roads) are
to migratory species, such as boreal (<em>Rangifer tarandus
caribou</em>) and barren-ground (<em>Rangifer tarandus
groenlandicus</em>) caribou in the Northwest Territories (NWT). Caribou
in this region are considered “threatened” under the NWT Species at Risk
Act and are known to encounter and avoid roads, which experience
variable traffic and deter animal crossings during their dispersal.</p>
<p>I am developing an R package centered on this issue (Barbour et al.,
<em>in prep</em>), where users will be able to use package functions
with biotelemetry data and spatial features of barriers to get an index
of permeability for any given linear barrier that is impacting a mobile
species of interest.</p>

<h3><strong>External Research (U.S. Department of Defense): Movement and
Survival of Endangered Sonoran Pronghorn in a Managed Rangeland (Paper
in Prep)</strong></h3>
<p><img src="PronghornSurvival.PNG" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>This project used a massive and long-running dataset of both
observational and radio-collared data of endangered Sonoran pronhorn
(<em>Antilocapra americana sonoriensis</em>) to understand their
survival and movement ecology within the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR)
in Arizona (for information, <a
href="https://www.aetc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/261238/sonoran-pronghorn-continue-to-thrive/">link</a>).</p>
<p>This subspecies of pronghorn has been in recovery since near
extinction in the early 2000’s and has experienced a variety of
management efforts (including captive-born releases to boost survival of
endangered herds). My research used a variety of quantitative methods
(including continuous time movement models, area-corrected home ranges,
behavioral change point analyses, generalized additive models, and
periodic hazard functions) with pronghorn biotelemetry data to
characterize their movement ecology, survival, and temporal occurrence
near anthropogenically disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Results support that active management efforts have been successful
in increasing survival, with pronghorn in this region having strong
seasonal trends in home range sizes, movement rates, group composition,
and proximity to military disturbance sites.</p>
<p>These findings have immediate relevance to current pronghorn
conservation initiatives and the comprehensive analysis used is
additionally highly applicable to other mobile species in actively
disturbed or resource-limited landscapes.</p>

<h3><strong>External Research (NSF-Funded SESYNC Fellowship): Assessing
Socio-Environmental Suitability and Social License of Proposed Offshore
Aquaculture Development: A Florida Case Study (Published)</strong></h3>
<p>Paper available at: <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13031">Guthrie et
al 2023, Journal of the World Aquaculture Society</a></p>
<p><img src="SuitabilityMap.PNG" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>This work stemmed from an interdisciplinary collaboration of graduate
women scientists from around the U.S. (including myself), with the aim
of producing a dynamic framework to inform the development of offshore
aquaculture in the U.S.</p>
<p>Our approach utilized a combination of biological, social, and
community publically-available data to assess community concerns,
socioeconomic vulnerability, and socio-ecological feasibility of
offshore aquaculture development.</p>
<p>As part of our approach to determining technical suitability of
offshore aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico, I performed a suitability
analysis to identify available areas of development for two different
finfish species, red drum (<em>Sciaenops ocellatus</em>) and almaco jack
(<em>Seriola rivoliana</em>). Results showed large areas of the Gulf to
be suitable for both species, but with potential for spatial conflict
with relevant communities in coastal and nearshore areas.</p>
<p>These results were integrated with other public data, including
public comments, media articles, and socio-environmental vulnerability
indices, to inform the impact of a recent proposed federal permit for a
pilot finfish farm project off the Florida Gulf coast (for information,
<a

<p><img src="DiveShapes.PNG" style="width:40.0%" /></p>
<p>I worked in collaboration with other scientists specializing in
machine learning with this paper to develop a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) model to classify sea turtle dive profiles by their shape,
an effort that previously has mostly been done by hand. We applied this
model to a large dataset of migratory dive profiles for Eastern Pacific
leatherback turtles (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>).</p>
<p>I then used dynamic time warp clustering (DTW) to further group
classified dives by their similarity in metrics (dive depth and
duration), resulting in two larger categories of dives that differed in
their dive metrics and proportion of different shapes. Generalized
additive mixed models were further used to determine the ecological
significance of these two dive types for leatherback turtles in the
Eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>This work represents a novel approach to classifying and determining
ecological significance of vertical movements and has potential to be
applied to other species with vertical movements (e.g., aerial).
Further, our CNN tool is published online as a broadly applicable tool
for classifying images of sea turtle dives!</p>

<p>South Pacific TurtleWatch, Dynamic Mapping Tool: <a

<p><img src="DMmaps.PNG" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>In this collaborative paper, I worked with the non-profit
organization, <a href="ww.upwell.org">Upwell</a>, to produce a dynamic
mapping product to inform where and when Eastern Pacific leatherback
turtles (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) are most at risk of interacting
with various fishing gear types when performing different (vertical and
horizontal) movement behaviors. This product has been incorporated into
South Pacific Turtle Watch, an online dynamic management tool for
Eastern Pacific leatherbacks.</p>
<p>I used a variety of quantitative methods to create our dynamic
mapping product, including developing a Hidden Markov model in Stan and
R that allowed us to identify distinct modes of behavior, using both
horizontal (swimming speed and turning angle) and vertical (proportion
of different dive types, see <a
href="(https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4384)">Barbour
et al 2023</a> variables. These behavioral predictions were combined
with monthly surfaces of fishing effort data for various fishing gears
and sea turtle kernel density to produce monthly predictive surfaces of
where leatherbacks in distinct behavioral modes have the highest
interaction risk with different fishing gears.</p>
<p>These dynamic maps are currently available online with Upwell’s South
Pacific TurtleWatch tool and will be distributed to stakeholders for
conservation and management of Eastern Pacific leatherbacks during their
migration.</p>

<p>With this research, I collaborated with the non-profit organization,
<a href="ww.upwell.org">Upwell</a>, as well as researchers at <a
href="https://biology.fau.edu/marine-lab/">Florida Atlantic
University</a>, to deploy novel miniature satellite tags on captive-born
juvenile green turtles (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>) in the Cayman
Islands.</p>
<p>We partnered with the <a href="https://www.turtle.ky/">Cayman Turtle
Conservation and Education Centre</a> to obtain captive-born, juvenile
turtles of various age classes (1-4 years), releasing them from two
different sites off of Grand Cayman.</p>
<p>I performed a variety of quantitative analyses to determine what was
driving differences in dispersal, including comparisons of turtle
directional headings with ocean currents and generalized additive mixed
models of turtle swimming persistence as a function of various potential
drivers.</p>
<p>I found that turtle trajectories were largely affected by differences
in spatial-temporal current structure but also demonstrated positive
potential for recruitment to known developmental and foraging areas for
green turtles in surrounding coastal areas. These are encouraging
results for the conservation of green turtles in the Cayman Islands, a
recovering population.</p>

<p>In this research, I worked in collaboration with the non-profit
organization, <a href="ww.upwell.org">Upwell</a>, and the <a
href="https://www.pacuarereserve.org/">Ecology Project
International/Pacuare Reserve</a> to tag neonate Caribbean leatherback
(<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) with acoustic tags and release them in
nearshore areas of Pacuare, Costa Rica. We also simultaneously released
ocean drifters, to measure fine-scale current directions and speeds.</p>
<p>Using a combination of quantitative models (first passage time,
random walk models, generalized additive mixed models), I characterized
the environmental drivers of variability in neonate dispersal
trajectories.</p>
<p>Results showed that despite a constant mean swimming speed across
individuals, in fast ocean current conditions, individual neonates
demonstrated behavioral variability in their swimming responses. This
study overall informs conservation efforts for this endangered
subpopulation in the Atlantic, including future releases of neonates and
potential headstarting efforts to boost population numbers.</p>
