### **Developed Syllabi**:

I teach Mammalogy (BSCI 334/335) in the Spring and as the sole teaching assistant for the course, I have been "revamping" it and developing/updating content. This is reflected in the syllabus written by me below. 

*Soon to come*: I am working on re-creating the TA manual and creating R-markdown documents for student final projects for this course.
